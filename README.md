# Alumni_career_choice_Analysis
Analyzing the choice of career for the Alumni of two different Engineering Colleges based on the collected data.
### **The main aim of this project is to analyze the available data of the alumni of two different Engineering Colleges to calculate the percentage of different career choices opted**

In this porject I took the liberty to play with the data and showcase my ability to create procedures in SQL
**The different Procedures created**:
1. Procedures to use String Functions for converting the records to lower case
2. Procedure to get the name of the alummni of each college separately.

To also showcase my ability to make pivot charts with the data in Excel, I am attaching the .xlsb file to this project. This is soley to demonstrate that I can work with excel by using the SQL connector. The pivot chart and the table are of not any logic and you may find it absurd.
